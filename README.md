# 🫀 NPLX Reproducibility Hub

This repository provides a reproducible analytical framework for identifying and validating an **NPL-centered plaque-core macrophage program** associated with foam remodeling in human atherosclerosis. The workflow integrates bulk transcriptomics, DNA methylation, single-cell RNA sequencing, cross-cohort validation, macrophage-state inference, trajectory analysis, virtual gene perturbation, cell–cell communication analysis, and exploratory translational validation.

The repository is organized for traceability, parameter transparency, modular execution, and figure-level regeneration.

## 🧹 Core analytical modules

### 🧬 Bulk transcriptomics

- Platform-specific annotation tables are prepared before expression harmonization.
- Probe-level matrices are converted to gene-level matrices.
- Cohort-specific differential expression is performed with `limma`.
- Consensus candidates are constructed across independent atherosclerosis datasets.
- Mechanism gene sets are scored across bulk expression layers.

### 🧪 DNA methylation

- `GSE46394` beta-value matrices and phenotype data are prepared separately from expression data.
- Methylation-level differential analysis is performed with `limma`.
- Methylation evidence is integrated with transcriptomic candidate scores.

### 🔬 Single-cell localization

- `GSE159677` is used for plaque-core and adjacent-tissue cell-type localization.
- Major vascular cell types include macrophages, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblast/mesenchymal cells, T cells, B cells, and mast cells.
- The NPL compact module is evaluated across cell types and macrophage states.
- `GSE155512` provides independent single-cell support.

### 🫧 Macrophage foam-remodeling axis

- Macrophage states include C1Q-like, inflammatory, IFN-like, and FOAM/TREM2-like programs.
- NPL-centered modules are constructed from core genes and foam-remodeling neighbors.
- Macrophage continuum, pseudobulk, patient-pair, and state-level analyses are retained as separate evidence layers.

### 🧠 Virtual perturbation and communication

- NPL-module-high and NPL-module-low macrophage groups are compared computationally.
- Virtual gene perturbation is performed using the project scTenifoldKnk-compatible workflow.
- Cell–cell communication is summarized using a cached human CellChat reference and sample-aware macrophage grouping.

## ⚙️ Key parameters and interpretation rules

- **NPL compact module:** `NPL`, `FABP5`, `GPNMB`, `APOC1`, `PLA2G7`, `SPP1`, `CD36`, `CYP27A1`, and `APOE`.
- **Primary macrophage comparison:** FOAM/TREM2-like versus C1Q-like macrophage states.
- **External validation principle:** independent cohorts are used as support layers rather than being treated as interchangeable replicas.
- **Patient-pair analyses:** paired core-versus-adjacent comparisons are preserved where sample metadata allow.
- **Null and robustness checks:** module null benchmarking, cross-cohort robustness, and perturbation sensitivity are retained in the result tables.
- **Statistical caution:** descriptive single-cell and communication results should be interpreted with their cohort size, sampling structure, and cell-level dependence in mind.

## 🎨 Figure regeneration

The main figure-specific script currently available is:

```bash
Rscript scripts/figures/plot_Figure3_single_cell_localization_compact_NPL_module.R
```

This script regenerates the NPL compact-module single-cell localization figure and exports panel-level data to `results/figure3/`. Other numbered R scripts write intermediate tables and figures to `res/`, `results/`, and `figures/` according to their module-specific configuration.

## 📦 Important outputs

- `res/tables/bulk/` — bulk differential-expression and translational classifier tables
- `res/tables/mechanism/` — methylation, NPL-module, macrophage-state, pseudobulk, and communication tables
- `res/qc/` — dataset, matrix, methylation, single-cell, and robustness summaries
- `results/figure3/` — panel-level exports and key numbers for the compact NPL localization figure
- `figures/main/` — main figure exports

## ♻️ Reproducibility and limitations

This project preserves raw public inputs, processed matrices, phenotype manifests, QC summaries, numbered scripts, and run history where available. Results should be interpreted alongside the following limitations:

- public cohorts differ in tissue source, platform, phenotype definition, and sample size;
- single-cell analyses are sensitive to cell-state annotation, sampling structure, and cell-level dependence;
- methylation and transcriptomic evidence are integrated as complementary association layers, not as proof of regulatory causality;
- trajectory inference and virtual perturbation are computational hypotheses that require experimental validation;
- CellChat-like communication scores depend on the reference database and sample grouping rules;
- translational blood analyses provide peripheral support rather than direct plaque-tissue confirmation.

Historical outputs and run records should be preserved when regenerating figures. New figure revisions should use a new version suffix rather than overwriting prior outputs.
